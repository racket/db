@title[#:tag "connect"]{Connections}

This section describes functions for creating connections as well as
administrative functions for managing connections.

@section[#:tag "creating-connections"]{Base Connections}

@declare-exporting[db]

There are four kinds of base connection, and they are divided into two
groups: @deftech{wire-based connections} and @deftech{FFI-based
connections}. PostgreSQL and MySQL connections are wire-based, and
SQLite and ODBC connections are FFI-based. See also
@secref["ffi-concurrency"].

Base connections are made using the following functions.

@defproc[(postgresql-connect [#:user user string?]
                  [#:database database string?]
                  [#:server server string? "localhost"]
                  [#:port port exact-positive-integer? 5432]
                  [#:socket socket (or/c path-string? 'guess #f) #f]
                  [#:password password (or/c string? #f) #f]
                  [#:allow-cleartext-password? allow-cleartext-password?
                   boolean? #f]
                  [#:ssl ssl (or/c 'yes 'optional 'no) 'no]

                  [#:notice-handler notice-handler
                   (or/c 'output 'error output-port?
                         (-> string? string? any))
                   void]
                  [#:notification-handler notification-handler
                   (or/c 'output 'error output-port?
                         (-> string? any)
			 (-> string? string? any))
                   void])
         connection?]{

  Creates a connection to a PostgreSQL server. Only the
  @racket[database] and @racket[user] arguments are mandatory.

  By default, the connection is made via TCP to @racket["localhost"]
  at port @racket[5432]. To make a different TCP connection, provide
  one or both of the @racket[server] and @racket[port] arguments.

  To connect via a local socket, specify the socket path as the
  @racket[socket] argument. You must not supply the @racket[socket]
  argument if you have also supplied either of the TCP arguments. See
  also @secref{connecting-to-server} for notes on socket
  paths. Supplying a @racket[socket] argument of @racket['guess] is
  the same as supplying @racket[(postgresql-guess-socket-path)].
  Sockets are only available under Linux (x86) and Mac OS X.

  If the server requests password authentication, the
  @racket[password] argument must be present; otherwise an exception
  is raised. If the server does not request password authentication,
  the @racket[password] argument is ignored and may be omitted.  A
  connection normally only sends password hashes (using the @tt{md5}
  authentication method). If the server requests a password sent as
  cleartext (un-hashed), the connection is aborted unless
  @racket[allow-cleartext-password?] is true.

  If the @racket[ssl] argument is either @racket['yes] or
  @racket['optional], the connection attempts to negotiate an SSL
  connection. If the server refuses SSL, the connection raises an
  exception if @racket[ssl] was set to @racket['yes] or continues with
  an unencrypted connection if @racket[ssl] was set to
  @racket['optional]. By default, SSL provides encryption but does not
  verify the identity of the server (see
  @hyperlink["http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/libpq-ssl.html"]{this
  explanation}). Host verification can be required via the
  @racket[ssl-context] argument; see @racket[ssl-set-verify!]. Some
  servers use SSL certificates to authenticate clients; see
  @racket[ssl-load-certificate-chain!] and
  @racket[ssl-load-private-key!]. SSL may only be used with TCP
  connections, not with local sockets.

  @margin-note{The ability to include a payload in a notification was
    added in PostgreSQL 9.0.}

  The @racket[notice-handler] is called on notice messages received
  asynchronously from the server. A common example is notice of an
  index created automatically for a table's primary key. The
  @racket[notice-handler] function takes two string arguments: the
  condition's SQLSTATE and a message. The
  @racket[notification-handler] is called in response to an event
  notification (see the @tt{LISTEN} and @tt{NOTIFY} statements); its
  arguments are the name of the channel, and the payload, as strings.
  If the handler only accepts a single argument, then it will be
  called without the payload. An output port may be supplied instead
  of a procedure, in which case a message is printed to the given
  port. Finally, the symbol @racket['output] causes the message to be
  printed to the current output port, and @racket['error] causes the
  message to be printed to the current error port.

  If the connection cannot be made, an exception is raised.

  Creates a connection to a MySQL server. If @racket[database] is
  @racket[#f], the connection is established without setting the
  current database; it should be subsequently set with the @tt{USE}
  SQL command.

  The meaning of the other keyword arguments is similar to those of
  the @racket[postgresql-connect] function, except that the first
  argument to a @racket[notice-handler] function is a MySQL-specific
  integer code rather than a SQLSTATE string, and a @racket[socket]
  argument of @racket['guess] is the same as supplying
  @racket[(mysql-guess-socket-path)].

  If the connection cannot be made, an exception is raised.

                [#:use-place use-place boolean? #f])
         connection?]{

  Opens the SQLite database at the file named by @racket[database], if
  @racket[database] is a string or path. If @racket[database] is
  @racket['temporary], a private disk-based database is created. If
  @racket[database] is @racket['memory], a private memory-based
  database is created.

  If @racket[mode] is @racket['read-only], the database is opened in
  read-only mode. If @racket[mode] is @racket['read/write] (the
  default), the database is opened for reading and writing (if
  filesystem permissions permit). The @racket['create] mode is like
  @racket['read/write], except that if the given file does not exist,
  it is created as a new database.

  SQLite uses @hyperlink["http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html"]{coarse-grained
  locking}, and many internal operations fail with the
  @tt{SQLITE_BUSY} condition when a lock cannot be acquired. When an
  internal operation fails because the database is busy, the
  connection sleeps for @racket[busy-retry-delay] seconds and retries
  the operation, up to @racket[busy-retry-limit] additional times. If
  @racket[busy-retry-limit] is @racket[0], the operation is only
  attempted once. If after @racket[busy-retry-limit] retries the
  operation still does not succeed, an exception is raised.

  If @racket[use-place] is true, the actual connection is created in
  a distinct @tech/reference{place} for database connections and a
  proxy is returned; see @secref["ffi-concurrency"].

  If the connection cannot be made, an exception is raised.

  Creates a connection to the ODBC Data Source named @racket[dsn]. The
  @racket[user] and @racket[password] arguments are optional, since
  that information may be incorporated into the data source
  definition, or it might not be relevant to the data source's driver.
  The @racket[notice-handler] argument behaves the same as in
  @racket[postgresql-connect].

  If @racket[strict-parameter-types?] is true, then the connection
  attempts to determine and enforce specific types for query
  parameters. See @secref["odbc-types"] for more details.

  By default, connections use ODBC's @tt{SQL_C_WCHAR}-based character
  encoding (as UTF-16) to send and receive Unicode character
  data. Unfortunately, some drivers' support for this method is
  buggy. To use @tt{SQL_C_CHAR} instead, set @racket[character-mode]
  to @racket['utf-8] or @racket['latin-1], depending on which encoding
  the driver uses.

  See @secref["odbc-status"] for notes on specific ODBC drivers and
  recommendations for connection options.

  If @racket[use-place] is true, the actual connection is created in

@section{Connection Pooling}

@declare-exporting[db db/base #:use-sources (db/base)]

Creating a database connection can be a costly operation; it may
involve steps such as process creation and SSL negotiation. A
@deftech{connection pool} helps reduce connection costs by reusing
connections.

@defproc[(connection-pool
             [connect (-> connection?)]
             [#:max-connections max-connections (or/c (integer-in 1 10000) +inf.0) +inf.0]
             [#:max-idle-connections max-idle-connections (or/c (integer-in 1 10000) +inf.0) 10])
         connection-pool?]{

Creates a @tech{connection pool}. The pool consists of up to
@racket[max-connections], divided between leased connections and up to
@racket[max-idle-connections] idle connections. The pool uses
@racket[connect] to create new connections when needed. The
@racket[connect] function is called with the same
@racket[current-custodian] value as when the connection pool was
created, and it must return a fresh connection each time it is called.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(eval:alts
 (define pool
   (connection-pool
    (lambda () (displayln "connecting!") (sqlite3-connect ....))
    #:max-idle-connections 1))
 (define pool
   (connection-pool
    (lambda () (displayln "connecting!") (sqlite3-connect #:database 'memory)))))
(define c1 (connection-pool-lease pool))
(define c2 (connection-pool-lease pool))
(disconnect c1)
(code:line (define c3 (connection-pool-lease pool)) (code:comment "reuses actual conn. from c1"))
]

See also @racket[virtual-connection] for a mechanism that eliminates
the need to explicitly call @racket[connection-pool-lease] and
@racket[disconnect].
}

@defproc[(connection-pool? [x any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[x] is a connection pool, @racket[#f]
otherwise.
}

@defproc[(connection-pool-lease
             [pool connection-pool?]
             [release (or/c evt? custodian?) (current-thread)])
         connection?]{

Obtains a connection from the connection pool, using an existing idle
connection in @racket[pool] if one is available. If no idle connection
is available and the pool contains fewer than its maximum allowed
connections, a new connection is created; otherwise an exception is
raised.

Calling @racket[disconnect] on the connection obtained causes the
connection to be released back to the connection pool. The connection
is also released if @racket[release] becomes available, if it is a
synchronizable event, or if @racket[release] is shutdown, if it is a
custodian. The default for @racket[release] is the current thread, so
the resulting connection is released when the thread that requested it
terminates.

When a connection is released, it is kept as an idle connection if
@racket[pool]'s idle connection limit would not be exceeded;
otherwise, it is disconnected. In either case, if the connection is in
a transaction, the transaction is rolled back.
}


@;{========================================}

@section{Virtual Connections}

@declare-exporting[db db/base #:use-sources (db/base)]

A @deftech{virtual connection} creates actual connections on demand and
automatically releases them when they are no longer needed.

@defproc[(virtual-connection
             [connect (or/c (-> connection?) connection-pool?)]
             #| [#:timeout timeout (and/c real? positive?) +inf.0] |#)
         connection?]{

Creates a @tech{virtual connection} that creates actual connections on
demand using the @racket[connect] function, or by calling
@racket[(connection-pool-lease connect)] if @racket[connect] is a
@tech{connection pool}. If @racket[connect] is a function, it is
called with the same @racket[current-custodian] value as when the
virtual connection was created.

A virtual connection encapsulates a mapping
of threads to actual connections. When a query function is called with
a virtual connection, the current thread's associated actual
connection is used to execute the query. If there is no actual
connection associated with the current thread, one is obtained by
calling @racket[connect]. An actual connection is disconnected when
its associated thread dies.

Virtual connections are especially useful in contexts such as web
servlets (see @secref["intro-servlets"]), where each request is
handled in a fresh thread. A single global virtual connection can be
defined, freeing each servlet request from explicitly opening and
closing its own connections. In particular, a @tech{virtual
connection} backed by a @tech{connection pool} combines convenience
with efficiency:

@racketblock[
(define the-connection
  (virtual-connection (connection-pool (lambda () ....))))
]

The resulting virtual connection leases a connection from the pool on
demand for each servlet request thread and releases it when the thread
terminates (that is, when the request has been handled).

When given a connection produced by @racket[virtual-connection],
@racket[connected?] indicates whether there is an actual connection
associated with the current thread. Likewise, @racket[disconnect]
causes the current actual connection associated with the thread (if
there is one) to be disconnected, but the connection will be recreated
if a query function is executed.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(eval:alts
 (define c
   (virtual-connection
    (lambda ()
      (printf "connecting!\n")
      (postgresql-connect ....))))
 (define c
   (virtual-connection
    (lambda ()
      (printf "connecting!\n")
      (dsn-connect 'db-scribble-env)))))
(connected? c)
(query-value c "select 1")
(connected? c)
(void (thread (lambda () (displayln (query-value c "select 2")))))
(disconnect c)
(connected? c)
(query-value c "select 3")
]

Connections produced by @racket[virtual-connection] may not be used
with the @racket[prepare] function. However, they may still be used to
execute parameterized queries expressed as strings or encapsulated via
@racket[virtual-statement].

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(prepare c "select 2 + $1")
(query-value c "select 2 + $1" 2)
(define pst (virtual-statement "select 2 + $1"))
(query-value c pst 3)
]
}

@(the-eval '(begin (set! c #f) (set! pst #f)))

@;{========================================}

@section[#:tag "kill-safe"]{Kill-safe Connections}

@declare-exporting[db db/base #:use-sources (db/base)]

@defproc[(kill-safe-connection [c connection?]) 
         connection?]{

Creates a proxy for connection @racket[c]. All queries performed
through the proxy are kill-safe; that is, if a thread is killed during
a call to a query function such as @racket[query], the connection will
not become locked or damaged. (Connections are normally thread-safe but
not kill-safe.)

Note: A kill-safe connection whose underlying connection uses ports to
communicate with a database server is not protected from a custodian
shutting down its ports.
}

@section{Data Source Names}

@declare-exporting[db db/base #:use-sources (db/base)]

A DSN (data source name) is a symbol associated with a connection
specification in a DSN file. They are inspired by, but distinct from,
ODBC's DSNs.

  Represents a data source. The @racket[connector] field determines
  which connection function is used to create the connection. The
  @racket[args] field is a partial list of arguments passed to the
  connection function; additional arguments may be added when
  @racket[dsn-connect] is called. The @racket[extensions] field
  contains additional information about a connection; for example,
  this library's testing framework uses it to store SQL dialect
  flags.

  Data sources can also be created using the
  @racket[postgresql-data-source], etc auxiliary functions.

  If @racket[dsn-file] does not exist, or if it contains no entry
  for @racket[dsn], an exception is raised. If @racket[dsn] is a
  @racket[data-source], then @racket[dsn-file] is ignored.

@section{System-specific Modules}

The @racketmodname[db] module exports all of the
functions listed in this manual except those described in
@secref["util"]. The database system-specific connection modules are
loaded lazily to avoid unnecessary dependencies on foreign libraries.

The following modules provide subsets of the bindings described in
this manual.

@defmodule*/no-declare[(db/base)]

Provides all generic connection operations (those described in
@secref{managing-connections} and @secref{query-api}) and SQL data
support (@secref{sql-types}).

@defmodule*/no-declare[(db/postgresql)]

Provides only @racket[postgresql-connect] and
@racket[postgresql-guess-socket-path].

@defmodule*/no-declare[(db/mysql)]

Provides only @racket[mysql-connect] and
@racket[mysql-guess-socket-path].

@defmodule*/no-declare[(db/sqlite3)]

Provides @racket[sqlite3-connect] plus @racket[sqlite3-available?]. When
the SQLite native library cannot be found, @racket[sqlite3-connect]
raises an exception.

@defmodule*/no-declare[(db/odbc)]

Provides only @racket[odbc-connect], @racket[odbc-driver-connect],
@racket[odbc-data-sources], and @racket[odbc-drivers]. In contrast to
@racketmodname[db], this module immediately attempts to
load the ODBC native library when required, and it raises an exception
if it cannot be found.
