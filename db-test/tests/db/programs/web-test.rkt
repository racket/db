#|
This program tests the combination of virtual connections and
connection pools in the context of web servlets, where servlet threads
may be killed unexpectedly if the client hangs up.

Errors to watch for:
 - connection-pool-lease: cannot obtain connection; connection pool limit reached
   Might mean a connection has become locked. Or could be a race condition, pool
   connection not released in time. (Seen in 5.2.1, not near-5.3 versions.)
 - tcp-write: error writing (Broken pipe)
   Probably okay, seems to come from web-server trying to write response.
 - TIMEOUT (and programs exits)
   This would be bad; all connections are locked up. I haven't seen it happen.
